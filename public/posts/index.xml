    <description><![CDATA[<p>This quick and straightforward how-to is the one I would have loved to have found while I was setting up <a href="https://www.squid-cache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Squid proxy</a> for a production application.</p>
<p>Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages.</p>
<p>I wanted to restrict access to the proxy to only authenticated users.
Here&rsquo;s how I did it.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>When I started my career in software, I&rsquo;ve always wondered when I would finally be a &ldquo;senior&rdquo; engineer.</p>
<p>Is it a matter of years of experience? Does it just happen suddenly?
After a few years on the job, I can tell that the answer is not so straightforward.</p>

    <title>Speeding up a Go cli application with concurrency</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>
<p>A few months ago I worked with a company which provided fully functional backend for online multiplayer games.
As part of their product portfolio, they provided their customers with a cli utility, called <code>ds-uploader</code> (dedicated server uploader).</p>
<p>Written in Go, this CLI helped the customer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process all files and assets in a directory of their choice containing their game server.</li>
<li>Synchronize each file to a remote object storage bucket (meaning to upload only files that are new or modified).</li>
<li>From those uploaded files, build a container image.</li>
<li>Pass that container image to another service, which would then be responsible to run it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the implementation details involved calling different services, both belonging to the service provider, and to the cloud provider of choice (in this case, AWS).</p>]]></description>

    <title>My experience passing Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) exam</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier in 2021, right after taking the exams for CKA and CKAD in succession (the experience of which I documented <a href="https://cuffaro.com/blog/2021-01-24-cka-ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">here</a>), I quickly booked the brand-new (at least at the time) CKS exam. Life happened, and I&rsquo;ve ended up procrastinating the study and preparation process until now ðŸ˜….</p>
<p>Today I got the great news of a PASS, and once again I would like to share my experience in obtaining this tough certification.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In December last year I was able to sit for the coveted Certified Kubernetes Administrator and Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exams, and clear them both after some preparation.</p>
<p>This post is meant to share my exam experience, and all the materials used.</p>
<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the exam questions carefully.</li>
<li>Know imperative commands with <code>kubectl</code> like the back of your hand.</li>
<li>Get comfortable looking things up on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">kubernetes.io</a>.</li>
<li>Build a bookmark folder in Chrome with relevant pages in kubernetes.io: you can use it during the exam!</li>
<li>Seriously, read the damn questions carefully.</li>
<li>Practice, practice and practice more.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-exams">The exams</h3>
<p>The exam for any of these Kubernetes certifications consists in solving a set of tasks, in a 2 hour terminal session.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Easy workflow for switching Python virtual environments</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The problem I set out to solve was simply to avoid manually typing pyenv/venv commands
when moving into directories containing different projects, and around my directory tree.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are like me, you would be working on different things at different times, and
switching projects around seamlessly becomes a requirement to avoid waste of time, attention and context.</p>
<h3 id="my-environment">My environment</h3>
<p>For the sake of clarity, I am using a Macbook Pro with macOS Mojave, and I have iTerm2
set up with <a href="https://www.zsh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ZSH</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Pitfalls I encountered while learning Go</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I started learning Go on and off out of curiosity, late last year.</p>
<p>Being mainly a Python developer, I figured learning a different programming language would help to broaden my horizons.</p>
<p>Recently though, we adopted the language for some work projects, therefore I took the plunge and got to really hacking around with it.</p>
<p>The following are some noobie gotchas that I bumped into during development of my latest project (link below).
Mostly these came around while trying to figure out how to use mocks and asserts in unit tests with the <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">testify</a> collection of packages.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting 2018: it was the first year I have coded full-time while getting also paid for it.
Before that, I worked mainly as internal IT support for a couple different companies, where my coding skills weren&rsquo;t being tested as much as right now.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie, the year wasn&rsquo;t always easy. I am surrounded by some brilliant people and I have very often felt some sort of inferiority complex that brought me down many a times; I thought that my experience (or lack thereof) was slowing down the team or not allowing us to achieve the goals we were supposed to achieve.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Making pyenv and neovim play nice (and a few gotchas found along the way)</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>For my development workflow and IDE, I&rsquo;ve recently decided to move from <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Vim</a>, to <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NeoVim</a>, which is essentially Vim on steroids.</p>
<p>No, but seriously, NeoVim has a <a href="https://neovim.io/charter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">few</a> features that are really interesting, but the real reason for moving is that, as a Python dev, I need to be able to look at source code and definitions very often, while hacking on my code.
The wonderful <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">jedi-vim</a> plugin normally allows me to do just that, when it comes to my local project. But because I am using virtual environments extensively in my work, such as with <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">virtualenv</a> and/or <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">pyenv</a>, I have a problem on my hands:</p>]]></description>
