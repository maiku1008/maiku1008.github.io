# 2024 11 30 Future Dev


What is required to be a good developer in the future?
Up until now, my answer would have been to get really good at one or two programming languages.

These days I'm not so sure.
Because of the different AI assistants available to us, coding some application even in a language that I never worked with before, is not that hard.
Most programming languages nowadays pretty much resemble each other

So it's the patterns that are important.
Knowing the patterns of what we need to work on and what we have worked on before is what is the point, and the key to be a successful developer in the next years
AI as a tool is making shallow coding tasks incredibly easy, therefore weeding out junior tasks.

What will be left then is the devs capable of seeing and working with the bigger picture, who have exposure to all parts of the stack, without necessarily being a master in none of them.
In short, Generalists will win, and the more exposure to different parts of development, the better
