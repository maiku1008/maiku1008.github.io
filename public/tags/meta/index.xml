    <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting 2018: it was the first year I have coded full-time while getting also paid for it.
Before that, I worked mainly as internal IT support for a couple different companies, where my coding skills weren&rsquo;t being tested as much as right now.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie, the year wasn&rsquo;t always easy. I am surrounded by some brilliant people and I have very often felt some sort of inferiority complex that brought me down many a times; I thought that my experience (or lack thereof) was slowing down the team or not allowing us to achieve the goals we were supposed to achieve.</p>]]></description>
