    <description><![CDATA[<p>When I started my career in software, I&rsquo;ve always wondered when I would finally be a &ldquo;senior&rdquo; engineer.</p>
<p>Is it a matter of years of experience? Does it just happen suddenly?
After a few years on the job, I can tell that the answer is not so straightforward.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The problem I set out to solve was simply to avoid manually typing pyenv/venv commands
when moving into directories containing different projects, and around my directory tree.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are like me, you would be working on different things at different times, and
switching projects around seamlessly becomes a requirement to avoid waste of time, attention and context.</p>
<h3 id="my-environment">My environment</h3>
<p>For the sake of clarity, I am using a Macbook Pro with macOS Mojave, and I have iTerm2
set up with <a href="https://www.zsh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ZSH</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell.</p>]]></description>
