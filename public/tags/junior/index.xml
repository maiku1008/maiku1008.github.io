<p>Is it a matter of years of experience? Does it just happen suddenly?
After a few years on the job, I can tell that the answer is not so straightforward.</p>

<p>Being mainly a Python developer, I figured learning a different programming language would help to broaden my horizons.</p>
<p>Recently though, we adopted the language for some work projects, therefore I took the plunge and got to really hacking around with it.</p>
<p>The following are some noobie gotchas that I bumped into during development of my latest project (link below).
Mostly these came around while trying to figure out how to use mocks and asserts in unit tests with the <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">testify</a> collection of packages.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
