    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Jujutsu</a> (<code>jj</code>) is a Git-compatible version control system that offers a different approach to managing your code history.
I have spent the last few weeks using Jujutsu (or <code>jj</code>) daily on personal and work git repositories.
One of its advantages is that you can use it locally alongside your team without them being aware that you&rsquo;re managing your code history differently.</p>
<p>Really, Jujutsu is a frontend for git, using git as its backend.
Your work is still based on a commit history, but the way you evolve your commits is different.</p>]]></description>
