    <description><![CDATA[<p>The problem I set out to solve was simply to avoid manually typing pyenv/venv commands
when moving into directories containing different projects, and around my directory tree.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are like me, you would be working on different things at different times, and
switching projects around seamlessly becomes a requirement to avoid waste of time, attention and context.</p>
<h3 id="my-environment">My environment</h3>
<p>For the sake of clarity, I am using a Macbook Pro with macOS Mojave, and I have iTerm2
set up with <a href="https://www.zsh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ZSH</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>For my development workflow and IDE, I&rsquo;ve recently decided to move from <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Vim</a>, to <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NeoVim</a>, which is essentially Vim on steroids.</p>
<p>No, but seriously, NeoVim has a <a href="https://neovim.io/charter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">few</a> features that are really interesting, but the real reason for moving is that, as a Python dev, I need to be able to look at source code and definitions very often, while hacking on my code.
The wonderful <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">jedi-vim</a> plugin normally allows me to do just that, when it comes to my local project. But because I am using virtual environments extensively in my work, such as with <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">virtualenv</a> and/or <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">pyenv</a>, I have a problem on my hands:</p>]]></description>
