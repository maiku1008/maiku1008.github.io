	<h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my page!<br>
    <br>
	I'm a 36 year old geek, married to a wonderful maltese woman and father of two awesome little girls.
    I'm a backend developer by trade and have worked in several gaming companies based in Malta;
    I also have worked as a sysadmin and webdev for some personal projects.
    I like to get my hands dirty in the terminal, and found inspiration in building software to make mine and others' life easier.<br>
    <br>
    This little page is an attempt for me to document some of my projects, and perhaps share with the world some things that I may learn in the process.
    <br>
    I hope it will be of some help to you.
    <br>
    <br>
    Michael
