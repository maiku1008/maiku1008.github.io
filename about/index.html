	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm a 34 year young geek, married to a wonderful maltese woman and father of two awesome little girls.
  I'm a friendly IT guy by trade and have worked in several gaming companies based in Malta.
  I also have worked as a sysadmin and dev for some personal projects.
  
  I like to get my hands dirty with terminal stuff, and found inspiration in building software to make mine and other's life easier.
  This little page is an attempt for me to document some of my projects, and perhaps share with the world some things that i may learn in the process.
