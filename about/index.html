	<h1>About me</h1>
    <p>This is the blog of a junior dev having fun with stuff. Welcome to my page!<br>
	I'm a 35 year young geek, married to a wonderful maltese woman and father of two awesome little girls.
  I'm a junior dev by trade and have worked in several gaming companies based in Malta.
  I also have worked as a sysadmin and dev for some personal projects.
  I like to get my hands dirty with terminal stuff, and found inspiration in building software to make mine and other's life easier.<br>
  This little page is an attempt for me to document some of my projects, and perhaps share with the world some things that i may learn in the process.
