      <description>Earlier in 2021, right after taking the exams for CKA and CKAD in succession (the experience of which I documented here ), I quickly booked the brand-new (at least at the time) CKS exam. Life happened, and I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up procrastinating the study and preparation process until now ðŸ˜….
Today I got the great news of a PASS, and once again I would like to share my experience in obtaining this tough certification.</description>

      <description>In December last year I was able to sit for the coveted Certified Kubernetes Administrator and Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exams, and clear them both after some preparation.
This post is meant to share my exam experience, and all the materials used.
TL;DR Read the exam questions carefully. Know imperative commands with kubectl like the back of your hand. Get comfortable looking things up on kubernetes.io . Build a bookmark folder in Chrome with relevant pages in kubernetes.</description>
