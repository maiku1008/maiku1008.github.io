      <description>For my development workflow and IDE, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently decided to move from Vim , to NeoVim , which is essentially Vim on steroids.
No, but seriously, NeoVim has a few features that are really interesting, but the real reason for moving is that, as a Python dev, I need to be able to look at source code and definitions very often, while hacking on my code. The wonderful jedi-vim plugin normally allows me to do just that, when it comes to my local project.</description>
